# Equations solver

An equation solving application, created with the Flutter framework, which can be run on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and web. This is a demo application that shows how the `equations` package can be used to solve equations and systems. If you want to play with this code, you need to have Dart 2.12.0 (or greater) and Flutter 2.0.0 (or greater) installed. The app is internationalized and it currently supports the following languages:

  - English
  - Italian

If you wish to add more languages, please create a new `app_xx.arb` file (replace `xx` with the language code) inside `lib/localization` and submit a PR! :rocket:
