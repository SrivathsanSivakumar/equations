# Examples

This folder contains some examples showing how the `equations` package can be used. In particular:

  - Inside `dart_example/` you'll find some examples of the `equations` package being used on a "pure" Dart application (so no Flutter dependencies).

  - Inside `flutter_example/` you'll find a Flutter app that uses the `equations` package to solve systems, equations, integrals and other utilities.

You can play with the Flutter example online at [https://albertodev01.github.io/equations/](https://albertodev01.github.io/equations/).
