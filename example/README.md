# Examples

This folder contains some examples showing how the `equations` package can be used. In particular:

  - Inside `dart/` you'll find some examples of the `equations` package being used on a "pure" Dart application (so no Flutter dependencies).
  - Inside `flutter/` you'll find a Flutter app that solves systems and equations using the `equations` package.
