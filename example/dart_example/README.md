This is a very simple Dart CLI app that shows how the `equations` package can be used, for example, to solve equations, evaluate integrals or analyze matrices. You can run it using

```bash
 $ dart run
```

from this location. If you want to create a portable binary file of this example (like an `.exe` file for Windows), see the [dart compile](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile) documentation for more info!
